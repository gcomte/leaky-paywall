== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Ice Dragon work? =

Users may buy access to your content on [ice-dragon.ch](https://ice-dragon.ch) over a short time period they can choose. You can configure paywalls globally for your WP site and there is a visibility setting on the post edit screen that lets you override the global settings. EG: Posts always show a paywall but this one does not.

= How does Lightning work? =

It's not very easy to grasp and setup at first, but once you've overcome the initial hurdles it's very easy and comfortable to use! Your users will need Bitcoin and a wallet. You'll only need a wallet because you are earning the Bitcoins! Custodial Wallets like the [Wallet of Satoshi](https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/) or [blue wallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are a good start, but eventually you'll want to create yourself a setup that's more secure. Always remember the wise words of the experienced Bitcoiners: *"Not Your Keys, Not Your Bitcoin. Not Your Node, Not Your Rules."*

= If I deactivate the Ice Dragon plugin, will I lose my configuration? =

No. You can deactivate the Ice Dragon plugin at any time without losing any configuration data.

= What can I do if something does not work as intended? =

Please don't hesitate to reach out to us. This is still an early-day implementation and we are happy to hear where the obstacles are and help you out with any issue. Just write an e-mail to lightning@puzzle.ch .
